# CMPS 6610 Extra Credit Answers
  
In this extra credit assignment, we will test and review concepts you
   have learned since the midterm exam. Please add your written answers
   to `answers.md` which you can convert to a PDF using
   `convert.sh`. Alternatively, you may scan and upload written
   answers to a file named `answers.pdf`.



1. **Algorithmic Paradigms**
- My favorite algorithmic paradigm is Dynamic Programming (DP). I think inituitively it is very interesting and elegant. More specifically, it is fascinating because it allows us to solve problems that initially appear to require exponential time (like $O(2^n)$) by identifying overlapping subproblems (for example, the Fibonacci sequence). Through memoization by simply caching (building a hash table) the results of these subproblems (top-down approach) or building them iteratively (tabulation) through a bottom-up approach, we can reduce the complexity to polynomial time (often $O(n^2)$ or $O(n^3)$). DP effectively illustrates the trade-off between space and time.


2. **Divide and Conquer**
- problems that can be solved by a divide and conquer approach necessarily satisfy the optimal substructure property?

3. **Randomization**

- 3a.
